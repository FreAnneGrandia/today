<p align= "justify"> <font face="MS Serif", size="4", color="black"> In these constant times of grueling tribulations, many problems and circumstances became harmful to humankind. 2020 is such a challenging yet disturbing year for all of us. This time is devastating for most of us, confronting the rage of our Mother Nature Calamities, the COVID-19 Pandemic, and even the internal conflicts in the society- Partisanships, Inequities, Prejudices, and even Injustice. This year has been a succinctly bit challenging, say the least, but after some deliberation, we’ve realized how equally extraordinary it’s been. Many problems of this modern generation have highlighted some of the widening inequalities within society relating to gender and ethnicity; the reigniting of movements like Black Lives Matter has also placed equality firmly center stage this year. Looking at the much brighter side, 2020 has provided us with many opportunities for learning and growth. We’ve all had to be more resilient than ever before, we’ve had to show compassion and care for those around us, and most of all, we’ve had to be innovative and continue to thrive. That is why this year of great predicament has been a bittersweet advantage to all of us. </font> </p>
