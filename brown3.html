No one doubts that the virus is one of the direst and distressing threats the world has ever faced. Dreadfulness and Anxiety have occurred to our conviction and contemplation as persons that have induced us in isolation.  And above all, our fear and distress are peaked by the dread of contracting coronavirus as we see each day the numbers of confirmed positive cases and deaths from COVID-19. Our sorrows run especially deep as we experience the reality or the struggle for the survival of friends or family members because of this disease. Correspondingly, in the business industry, many lost their jobs, and unemployment became dominant in lay-offs. Some people may find it very difficult and intricate to comprehend because it is a worldwide catastrophe; individuals are getting dominated by our pessimistic thoughts and opinions to become more discouraged and hopeless. Our Everyday life has been disturbed because of COVID-19 and the whole world is at a halt. When we look at the present situation, every person is confined to their own homes. Some workers are restrained within compact and non-workable spaces and paid more attention to these things by working online, which would have had some comfort, workability, and exposure to the outer world while staying inside. In optimistic ways, the days in lockdown were an opportunity for young individuals to reinvent ways of learning and exploring their immediate environment, and making the most of what they had available. Building resilience in youth is one way that can help them to cope in difficult moments. This crisis has indeed taken its toll on humanity. Nevertheless, it also provided an opportunity for generations to unite and perhaps begun to shape our younger generations to think differently about their roles and how we as individuals can all contribute in our way to find a resolution to distinctive problems. </font> </p>
