<h1 align=center> INFLUENCE OF INTERNAL CONFLICTS: A RAGING DILEMMA </h1>

<p align= "justify"> <font face="MS Serif", size="4", color="black"> In the Philippines, War on Illegal Drugs is still visible even in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis, with new cases appearing in the media daily. The modus operandi for the killings involved police raiding homes to apprehend alleged drug dealers or users, who instead of being taken into custody would be reported dead, with the police claiming self-defense. Human Rights Watch has documented the police embedding weapons near suspects' bodies to justify their lethal use of force; this has become an internal conflict within the country because of the unlawful actions exerted by the government officials. The government’s brutal “war on drugs” has devastated the lives of innumerable children and their families. Human Rights Watch research in the past year shows that the killing of breadwinners has resulted in psychological trauma and economic hardships for affected families, with many young juveniles having to stop going to school and start working. Some of these youngsters are bullied in schools and their communities; many are induced to the extreme poverty that forces them to live in the streets. The government has done little to address the consequences of its “drug war.” In addition, the Philippine Congress has failed to pass pending legislation by forbidding discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, education, health care, housing, and other domains. It also has not relinquished legislation recognizing same-sex partnerships and extending benefits to same-sex couples. The issues of times of modernity have become a major dilemma to the community. Therefore, immediate actions and operations should be implemented as soon as possible so that conflicts in our society should somehow diminish the burden that is constantly overlooked by the nation. </font> <p>
